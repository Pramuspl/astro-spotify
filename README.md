# Astro Spotify API Components

This package contains components interacting with the Spotify API.

## Setup

To use this package, you need a [Spotify Developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/). Create an app there to get a `Client ID` and `Client secret`.

Make sure to set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000`. Currently, the package only uses `Web API`.

Once you have your `Client ID` and `Client secret`, save them in your project's `.env` file as:

- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### Authorization

To get access to your Spotify data, you need to authorize the app.

#### 1. Authorization Code

First, you'll need to get the authorization code. Open the following link in the browser, replacing:

- `<CLIENT_ID>` with your credentials:
- `<SCOPE>` depending on your usage:
  - for \<CurrentlyPlaying> Component: `user-read-currently-playing`

[https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=\<CLIENT_ID>&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000&scope=\<SCOPE>&response_type=code](https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000&scope=<SCOPE>&response_type=code)

You'll be promopted by Spotify to allow access to your data.
Once you do it, you'll be redirected to you localhost:

`http://localhost:3000/?code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>`

Copy the `code` from the URL and save it. You'll need it in the next step.

#### 2. Refresh Token

The next step is getting the refresh token. The package contains a helper function to assist you with that.

```TypeScript
import { getRefreshToken } from "astro-spotify";
const refreshToken = await getRefreshToken(
  import.meta.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID,
  import.meta.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET,
  "<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>"
);

console.log(refreshToken);
```

Save the token in your `.env` file as `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` and remove the `getRefreshToken` call from your code as you won't need it anymore.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You can only run `getRefreshToken()` once. Subsequent runs will return an error and you'd need to request a new authorization code from the previous step.

Your `.env` file should contain following properties:

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=
```

If it does, you're ready to go!

## Usage

### Currently Playing

The component allows you to display the currently playing song.

```TypeScript
import { CurrentlyPlaying } from "astro-spotify";

<CurrentlyPlaying
  clientID={import.meta.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}
  clientSecret={import.meta.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}
  refreshToken={import.meta.env.SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN}
/>
```
